(C) Cells bearing shPak1 and shPak2 were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. The data are representative of 3 independent experiments. (D) KT21 cells harboring either shPak1 or shPak2 were stereotactically injected at the skull base and the mice were fed with doxycycline diet or normal rodent foods for 5 weeks.

LPA (10 \u03bcM, 8 hr)-induced AREG in CM was YAP- and LPA3-, but not LPA1-dependent (c). LPA-induced AREG production/secretion was blocked by dn-G13, dn-RhoA, but not PTX (100 ng/mL, 16 hr) or dn-Gq (d and e). C, LPA-induced short-term migration (4 hr) was not dependent on YAP or transcription (ActD, 1 \u03bcg/mL, 1 hr pretreatment), but was sensitive to PTX (100 ng/mL, 16 hr), LY294002 (10 \u03bcM, 1 hr pretreatment) and dn-Rac1 transfection (a). LPA-induced long-term cell migration was sensitive to ActD and CHX treatment (20 \u03bcg/mL, 1 hr pretreatment), as well as PTX and LY294002 (b). Data are from three independent experiments (means \u00b1 SD). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. D, Summary the LPA-YAP signaling pathway revealed in this work (OVCA433 cell line, left panel) and the previous work [1] (HEK293A cell line, right panel)."

(C) NF2 gene expression levels were different, with low expression in 13 meningiomas. (Group: Ara, Arachnoid membrane; NF2-H and NF2-L, meningiomas with normal and low NF2 expression, respectively) (D) TGM2 expression was inversely correlated with NF2 gene expression.

Insets with (D) and (E) show the strong and intermediate precondylar constrictions, respectively. Dotted gray lines show the intersection of hypothetical extensions of the ventrolateral surfaces. With a strong precondylar constriction, the lines intersect anterior to the vertebral condyle, but the intersection occurs beyond the level of the condyle in taxa with weak precondylar constriction. Abbreviations: acpr, anterostapedial process of the prootic crest; con, condyle; cpr, prootic crest (crista prootica); pcc, area of precondylar constriction; prz, prezygapophysis; pzgs, pseudozygosphene; syn, synapophysis."

After being trapped inside the vehicle for approximately one hour, he was extricated and flown to a local trauma center. He was diagnosed with an open, Grade IIIC left-sided AO/OTA Type C3.3 distal femur fracture with segmental defect and an ipsilateral tibial shaft fracture. External fixation was placed for initial stabilization, and antibiotic beads were subsequently placed in the defect at 3 days following injury. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was performed with placement of an intramedullary (IM) locked nail for treatment of the tibial shaft fracture and then ORIF of the distal femur fracture with placement of a less invasive stabilization system (LISS) locking plate and screws. One week later, the antibiotic beads were removed and the defect was prepared for bone graft placement. A second incision was made along the lateral border of the ipsilateral fibula, and a free vascularized fibula bone graft was harvested for transplant to the femoral defect. It was docked in a double barrel fashion and stabilized using screw fixation. Following surgery, he returned for regular follow-up visits. Three months after surgery, all of the fractures were healing with incorporation of bone graft. The LISS plate was removed 4.5 years following the initial surgery.

Starting on day 6 post infection, infected mice were divided into 2 groups and treated orally with chloroquine (25 mg/kg b.w.), chloroquine plus desferoxamine (DFX, 20 mg/kg b.w., i.p.), chloroquine plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) or with the combination of chloroquine/DFX/NAC for 7 days. On day 15 and 16 post-infection all the animals were submitted to open field task training and test sessions, respectively. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. of crossings (A and C) and rearings (B and D) in training (gray bars) and test (black bars) sessions; *significant difference between groups in training and test sessions (p<0.05, Student's T test). Panels E\u2013M ilustrate histological examinations (H&E staining) of different brain regions in non-infected (RBC), infected (PRBC, PbA 106) and mice treated with the combination of chloroquine/DFX/NAC (PbA+Cq+AOX). E\u2013G) cerebral cortex; H\u2013J) hippocampus; K\u2013M) and cerebellum. Microvascular congestion and plugging (arrows) were detected in all analyzed regions in PbA-infected mice, but were not seen in controls or treated animals rescued with chloroquine and additive antioxidants. Scale bar, 100 \u00b5m."

(C) Lungs of saline, untreated (\u2212) or curcumin-treated (+) reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice on day 14 post-inoculation were paraffin embedded and stained with an Abs to TN-C (red), \u03b1-SMA (red), or E-cadherin (green).

The bent pore-lining M2 helices are somewhat separated from the ring of M1/M3 helices, most especially in the extracellular portion of the bilayer. The M2 helices only make significant contacts with each other at the middle of the membrane and in the intracellular leaflet of the bilayer. At least two rings of hydrophobic side-chains (indicated by the yellow sticks, at positions 9\u2032 and 13\u2032) project into the pore from the encircling helices, to create a barrier for ion permeation near the middle of the membrane. The arrows indicate the directions in which \u03b1\u03b3M2 and \u03b4M2 flex to straighten when the channel opens."

(a) View down the axis of the receptor (extracellular side uppermost) showing the symmetrical pentagonal arrangement made by the \u223c40 \u00c5 long transmembrane \u03b1-helices. Each subunit contributes four helices, M1-M4, which are splayed apart at their extracellular ends, but come closer together towards the intracellular membrane surface, creating a tapered central pore. The bent pore-lining M2 helices are somewhat separated from the ring of M1/M3 helices, most especially in the extracellular portion of the bilayer. The M2 helices only make significant contacts with each other at the middle of the membrane and in the intracellular leaflet of the bilayer.

The arrows indicate the directions in which \u03b1\u03b3M2 and \u03b4M2 flex to straighten when the channel opens. (b) Side view with the front two subunits removed, showing the tapered pore profile made by the bent M2 helices of the \u03b1\u03b3 and \u03b4 subunits. The pore narrows from the extracellular side (uppermost) to become most constricting near the middle of the bilayer (asterisk), where the large hydrophobic residues are located. The density contours superimposed on the atomic model are from the 6-\u00c5 closed-class structure (see Section 5), i.e. using data from different helical families than were used to derive the model. The indicated curvature and positions of the helices are the same in either case. The locations of specific pore-facing amino acid residues on \u03b1\u03b3M2 (at positions: \u22121\u2032 (E), 2\u2032 (T), 9\u2032 (L), 13\u2032 (V) and 20\u2032 (E)) are shown. The pink contours indicate the locations of the rings of density associated with the phospholipid headgroup regions of the lipid bilayer (see Fig. 5a)."
