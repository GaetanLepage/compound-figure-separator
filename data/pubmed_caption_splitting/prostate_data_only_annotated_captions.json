Immunohistochemical analysis of serial TMA sections from a patient with Gleason's score of 8, revealed higher expression of TGF-beta, p-ERK, DNMTs, but lower expression of TbetaRI and TbetaRII and p-Smad2 as compared to serial sections taken from a patient with a lower Gleason's grade of 6. These results are representative of the predominant staining pattern seen in all patient samples/tissue arrays (magnification: 10*20). The corresponding frequency (or percentage) of staining and intensity of staining could be found on B. B. High levels of TGF-beta1 expression (Score = 3) were identified in 42.3%, 8.9% and 7.0%, p-Erk expression in 36.4%, 6.7% and 13.5%, DNMT1 expression in 27.9%, 1.8% and 1.3%, DNMT3A expression in 40.6%, 11.9% and 6.7%, and DNMT3B expression in 58.7%, 18.3% and 22.8% of high (>=8), intermediate ( = 7), and low Gleason grade (<=6), respectively."
