CD155 expression was elevated in fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) vs. normal fibroblasts (Hs27) and also in glioblastoma cells (U87MG) vs. normal human astrocytes (NHA). Antibody specificity is demonstrated using HT1080 cells in which CD155 expression is knocked down by RNAi. beta-actin is shown as a loading control. (b) CD155 protein expression was examined by immunocytochemistry across a panel of normal and cancer tissue samples. In normal tissue we observed moderate staining in kidney, plasma cells, liver, lung, theca interna of the ovary, and testis. No staining was observed in normal adrenal, bladder, brain, breast, colon, heart, pancreas, placenta, prostate, skin, skeletal muscle, small intestine epithelium, spleen, stomach, thymus, thyroid, or uterus. In cancer tissue, significant staining was observed in prostate, renal cell, and pancreatic carcinomas as well as in colon, non-small cell lung, ovarian, and breast carcinomas. (c) High CD155 protein expression was also observed in glioblastoma tumor tissue. Two types of staining were evident: scattered positive cells (arrows) in a primarily negative sample, or diffuse staining across many cells in a sample."

Breast cancer metastases are usually osteolytic, whereas prostate cancer metastases are usually osteoblastic. Osteolytic metastasis: Osteolytic metastasis of tumor cells involves a \"vicious cycle\" between tumor cells and the skeleton. The vicious cycle is propagated by four contributors: tumor cells, bone-forming osteoblasts, bone resorbing osteoclasts and stored factors within bone matrix. Osteoclast formation and activity are regulated by the osteoblast, adding complexity to the vicious cycle. Tumor cells release certain factors including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, PTHrP and TNF that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. These factors enhance the expression of RANKL over OPG by osteoblasts, tipping the balance toward osteoclast activation thus causing bone resorption. This bone lysis stimulates the release of BMPs, TGFbeta, IGFs and FGFs for stimulating the growth of metastatic cancer cells to bone. Osteoblastic metastasis: Factors released by osetoblastic cells, such as ET-1, Wnt, ERBB3, VEGF play an important role in osteoblastic metastasis by increasing cancer cell proliferation and enhance the effect of other growth factors including PDGF, FGFs, IGF-1. Osteoblast differentiation is also increased by BMPs through the activation of certain transcription factors. Urokinase Plasminogen Activator (uPA), a protease, also acts as mediator for osteoblastic bone metastasis by cleaving osteoclast-mediated bone resorption factors responsible for regulation of osteoclast differentiation; thereby blocking the bone resorption."

In the normal gland high OTUB1 expression is observed in basal epithelial cells and in adjacent stromal cells, and increased expression is observed in tumor epithelial cells compared to normal luminal epithelium. II, negative control staining for A. III, example of a prostate tumor with Gleason score of 8 exhibiting moderate staining of epithelial tumor cells. IV, a tumor with Gleason score of 9 showing strong staining of tumor cells. (B) Distribution of OTUB1 expression across prostate tissue samples with different Gleason grades are shown as bar graphs while relative numbers are shown as pie charts. Chi-square p value comparing OTUB1 expression in malignant versus non-malignant prostate tissues and OTUB1 expression across the different histological Gleason score grades are shown.

What the pathologists did not know was that from each of the 20 prostate carcinomas, two HPFs were shown, once before a low power image with well-formed tubular structures (corresponding to a combined Gleason grade 2-3) and again some time later before a low power image showing solid tumor architecture (corresponding to a combined Gleason grade 4-5). The presentation was automatically timed to show each slide fir exactly 8 seconds. Pathologists were asked to assign nuclear grades for each HPF. This part of the presentation lasted for a little over 10 minutes. Immediately after that, 40 slides were shown that depicted 10 random nuclei from each of the displayed HPFs, arranged in a 2*5 matrix (see figure 2)."

The Gleason score for each disease focus is shown in the top left-hand corner of the image of each tumour focus. A single sample that contained a focus of basal cell hyperplasia, two samples with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, two samples of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and three samples of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are shown. The brown stain from the biotinylated secondary antibody indicates the EphB4 protein. Nuclei are stained with Harris haematoxylin and appear blue. Staining of normal tissues was either absent or weak and diffuse. Increased staining of the tumour tissue appeared to correlate with increased Gleason score. There was no cross-reactivity with the secondary antibody alone (result not shown)."

The staining procedure was the following: first the tissue section was stained for AR and pictures acquired through TRF, then the AR was washed off, the section was stained for H&E and a new picture was acquired through brightfield microscopy. Considering that AR is the protein to be quantified, it is important that AR expression is preserved and therefore that the tissue is minimally stressed. Since the tissue is processed twice and this might alter its structure and protein content, we have performed AR as the first staining. H&E on the other hand did not seem to be highly influenced by intermediate steps."

It also secretes factors that allow detachment from primary site and migration into blood vessels. Cancer cells then migrate through the blood circulation and are attracted towards bone. Subsequent extravasation and growth within and invasion of bone occurs involving complex interactions between the tumor and the local bone microenvironment. This ultimately leads to osteoclast-induced bone destruction and pathological fracture, and the expanding tumor mass impinges on the adjacent neural structures and spinal cord, causing neurological deficit and paralysis."

Culturing the UGS with testosterone and DFMO decreased the number of prostatic buds compared to the testosterone treatment, and comparable to the no steroid control UGS (C). For each treatment, the numbers of buds were counted. Testosterone induced significantly more buds compared to no steroid treatment, and treating UGS tissues with DFMO and testosterone significantly decreased the number of buds compared to testosterone alone (D). Culturing the UGS for six days did not adversely affect the histology of cells regardless of whether they were cultured in NS media (E), T (F) or T+DFMO (G) media.

Aged-matched ApcMin/+ mice with H. hepaticus, develop significantly more PIN and microinvasiveCA lesions (asterisk) characterized by highly atypical prostate gland epithelial cells which break through the basal lamina and infiltrate the adjacent stroma (b). When mesenteric lymph node cells from H. hepaticus-infected ApcMin/+ mice are transferred into the peritoneal cavity of H. hepaticus-free ApcMin/+ mice the recipient mice develop preneoplastic and early neoplastic lesions (microinvasiveCA-asterisk) comparable to those found in donor mice (c).

The normal glandular epithelial cell expresses ZIP1 that permits zinc accumulation, which inhibits citrate oxidation and terminal respiration. Citrate accumulates and coupled ATP production is reduced. A genetic transformation results in a neoplastic cell with potential malignant capability. ZIP1 expression is silenced by epigenetic factors which eliminate Zip1 transporter and accumulation of zinc in the premalignant cell. The level of cellular zinc decreases which removes the inhibitory effects on citrate oxidation and terminal oxidation. The Krebs cycle is functional and coupled ATP production is increased. The malignant cell is metabolically and bioenergetically capable of manifesting its malignant potential. Additionally, the growth inhibitory effect of zinc is removed, which allows growth and progression of the malignant cell."

Cancer was scored metastatic if one or more distal metastases to either the lungs, kidneys or liver were detected histologically. Examples of tumours at each grade are shown in e, whereas that of normal prostate and hyperplasia are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

As this correlation is computed on all samples, the resulting value (x-axis) was denoted as JSM0A-Spearman.

Using a 5-biomarker panel that included SPP1, Kashani-Sabet et al. used tissue microarrays on 693 melanocytic neoplasms to show that SPP1 expression collaborates significantly improving the detection of high percentage of melanomas arising in a nevus, Spitz nevi, dysplastic nevi and misdiagnosed lesions [253]. Like in the case of prostate cancer (Figure 3, in which KLK3/PSA - Prostate Specific Antigen was highlighted), our method allows the detection of important biomarkers with a high degree of concordance with current biological understanding of metastatic processes."

For these experiments, human PR-B; SRC-2 (both cloned into pCR3.1) and the luciferase reporter pGRE.E1b.LUC were transiently cotransfected into HeLa cells in the presence or absence of 10-7M R5020, as described previously (Lonard et al., 2004); results are expressed in relative light units (RLU).  Panel B shows SRC-2 is expressed in the majority of epithelial cells of the human prostate (black arrow), an established cellular target for androgen receptor action (Culig et al., 2002); note: the stromal compartment registers negative for SRC-2 expression (blue arrow).  Panels C and D show transverse sections of the luminal and stromal compartment (with surrounding stroma) of the human endometrium stained for PR and SRC-2 expression, respectively.  Note that PR and SRC-2 are detected in nuclei of the same cell types in both cellular compartments (black and red arrows, respectively).  The blue arrow in panels C and D highlights a stromal cell negative for PR and SRC-2 expression, respectively; scale bar in panel C applies to panel D.  Endometrial biopsies were obtained by endometrial pipelle from healthy women with normal cycles (aged between 18-35 years) during the mid-secretory (luteal) phase of the menstrual cycle (days 20-24, which is based on the ideal 28 day cycle, in which day 1 represents the first day of menstrual flow and day 14 the day of ovulation); cycle phase was determined relative to the timing of the urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge.  Immunohistochemical detection of human SRC-2 and PR was undertaken using established methods previously reported by our group (Lee et al., 2005; Mukherjee et al., 2006b).  Panel E shows a representative example of a normal type 1 terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) of the human breast in which SRC-2 expression is restricted to the epithelial compartment (black arrow).  Panel F is a higher magnification of the region indicated by the black arrow in panel E.  Note that SRC-2 expression is confined to a subset of epithelial cells of the TDLU (black arrow indicates an epithelial cell scoring positive for SRC-2 expression, whereas the red arrow highlights an epithelial cell which is negative for SRC-2 expression; blue arrow denotes a stromal cell which is negative for SRC-2 expression).  Interestingly, the spatial expression pattern of mammary SRC-2 resembles that previously reported for ER-alpha and PR in the human breast (Clarke et al., 1997).  With institutional review board approval, human tissue samples were obtained from Baylor College of Medicine affiliated hospitals.
