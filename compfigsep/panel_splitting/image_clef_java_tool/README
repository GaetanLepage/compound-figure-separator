Compound Figure Separation - Evaluation Tool
********************************************

This program allows evaluating a compound figure separation XML run file against
a given ground truth file. It was developed in the context of ImageCLEF, the
cross-language image retrieval evaluation benchmark.

To evaluate a file and get the results, use the following command:

java -jar CFSEvaluation.jar <path_of_ground_truth_xml_file> <path_of_candidate_xml_file>
